# UrlRecommenderPlugin

The `UrlRecommenderPlugin` is a class that interacts with the OpenAI API to recommend URLs based on the user's browsing history. 

## Constructor

The constructor for `UrlRecommenderPlugin` takes an API key for the OpenAI service.

```javascript
constructor(apiKey)
```


## Methods

```javascript
recommendUrlsMonth()
```

This method collects the user's browsing history from the past month, and sends it to the OpenAI API to get URL recommendations. The recommended URLs are then returned.

## Usage

```javascript
const urlRecommenderPlugin = new urlRecommenderPlugin(apiKey);
urlRecommenderPlugin.recommendUrlsMonth();
```

This will initialize a new instance of `UrlRecommenderPlugin` and recommend URLs based on the user's browsing history for the past month. Be sure to replace the apiKey in the constructor with your actual OpenAI API key.

### Note

When using the `recommendUrlsMonth` method, handle the returned promise appropriately to catch any errors that may occur during the API call.

Ensure you have the correct OpenAI API key and that you handle and secure it appropriately.
