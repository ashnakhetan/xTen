With a sharp increase in AI-powered applications, there is need to develop tools that make the development pipeline easy. This is especially true in the case of browser extensions, where APIs like ChatGPT are used to create interactive tools.

There is currently no clear and easy package that allows developers to easily integrate their preferred AI APIs into their browser extension workflows. This is the problem we are tackling -- our goals are listed below!

 
1. Create a plugin system: Design our package with a plugin system that allows developers to easily integrate their preferred AI APIs. This can be achieved by defining a clear interface that plugins must implement to work with our package.
2. Define the API interface: Clearly specify the methods and properties that AI plugins should expose. This will ensure a consistent integration experience for developers regardless of which AI API they use. For example, we might define methods for text analysis, image recognition, and machine learning tasks.
3. Provide documentation and samples: Create comprehensive documentation on how to develop plugins for our package. Provide sample code for common AI APIs to guide developers in creating their own plugins. Encourage the developer community to contribute plugins for various AI APIs, expanding the package's compatibility.
4. Build core features with plugin support: Develop the core features of our package (e.g., scraping, injecting code, and personalized suggestions) in a way that leverages the plugin system. This will allow developers to seamlessly integrate their AI API of choice while using your package's functionality.
5. Ensure compatibility: While implementing the core features, we will make sure that they work well with different AI APIs by testing them with a variety of plugins. This will help us identify and address any compatibility issues.
6. Encourage collaboration and contributions: Foster a community around our package that encourages developers to share their plugins, suggest improvements, and report any issues they encounter. This will help our package grow and improve over time!
